This notebook performs sentiment analysis on a dataset of Amazon product reviews.  Here's a breakdown:

1. **Data Loading and Preparation:**
   - Loads a CSV file ('Reviews.csv') containing product reviews into a pandas DataFrame.
   - Downsamples the dataset to the first 500 reviews for faster processing.
   - Explores the distribution of review scores (1-5 stars) using a bar chart, revealing a bias towards positive reviews.

2. **Basic NLTK Analysis (Example):**
   - Demonstrates basic Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) operations on a single review:
     - Tokenization (splitting text into words)
     - Part-of-speech tagging
     - Named entity recognition

3. **VADER Sentiment Scoring:**
   - Uses NLTK's VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) to calculate sentiment scores (positive, negative, neutral, and compound) for each review.
   - Merges these scores back into the main DataFrame.
   - Visualizes the relationship between review stars and the compound sentiment score, as well as the positive, neutral, and negative scores, using bar plots.

4. **RoBERTa Sentiment Scoring:**
   - Employs a more advanced pre-trained transformer model (RoBERTa) for sentiment analysis, leveraging contextual information.
   - Defines a function to calculate RoBERTa sentiment scores for a given text.
   - Applies this function to all reviews, adding RoBERTa's negative, neutral, and positive scores to the DataFrame.

5. **Comparison of VADER and RoBERTa:**
   - Creates a pairplot to visualize the relationships between the sentiment scores from both models, colored by the actual review star rating. This allows for a comparison of how well each model performs.

6. **Review Examples:**
   - Examines specific examples of reviews where the model's sentiment scores disagree with the given star rating (e.g., positive sentiment for a 1-star review). This highlights the limitations and nuances of sentiment analysis.

7. **Transformers Pipeline:**
   - Shows a quick and easy way to use a sentiment analysis pipeline from the Transformers library to demonstrate sentiment analysis on a couple of quick examples.
